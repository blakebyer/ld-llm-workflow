input_text: Among the clinical findings found in MPS are general manifestations,
  such as short stature, infiltrated facies, thick eyebrows, as well as 
  orthopedic manifestations (joint hypermobility or joint stiffness without 
  inflammation, skeletal deformities, and multiple dysostosis), cardiac 
  manifestations (murmur, myocardiopathy, mitral-aortic valve disease, 
  cardiomegaly), and respiratory manifestations (hypertrophy of tonsils, 
  adenoids, frequent respiratory infections). In other patients, there are 
  umbilical and/or inguinal hernias, global retardation of psychomotor 
  development, and the progressive loss of motor and intellectual skills they 
  had already acquired in all but attenuated phenotypes and MPS IV and VI.
