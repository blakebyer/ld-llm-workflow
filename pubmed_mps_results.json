    "title": "Mucopolysaccharidoses: early diagnostic signs in infants and children.",
    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) comprise a group of lysosomal disorders that are characterized by progressive, systemic clinical manifestations and a coarse phenotype. The different types, having clinical, biochemical, and genetic heterogeneity, share key clinical features in varying combinations, including joint and skeletal dysplasia, coarse facial features, corneal clouding, inguinal or abdominal hernias, recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, heart valve disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, and variable neurological involvement. In the severe forms, these features usually appear in the first months of life, but a correct diagnosis is often reached later when suggestive signs are manifest. All MPS types may have severe or attenuated presentations depending on the residual enzymatic activity of the patient. Based on data from the literature and from personal experience, here we underline the very early signs of the severe forms which should alert the paediatrician on their first appearance. A few early signs are typical of MPS (i.e. gibbus) while many are unspecific (hernias, upper airway infections, organomegaly, etc.), and finding the association of many unspecific signs might prompt the paediatrician to search for a common cause and to carefully look for other more specific signs (gibbus and other skeletal deformities, heart murmur). We stress the need to increase awareness of MPS among paediatricians and other specialists to shorten the still existing diagnostic delay. A timely diagnosis is mandatory for the commencement of treatment as soon as possible, when available, to possibly obtain better results.",

    "title": "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidoses.",
    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are estimated to affect1 in 25,000 live births although specific rates vary between the ethnic origin and country. MPS are a group of lysosomal storage disorders, which cause the buildup of GAG(s) due to insufficient or absent GAG-degrading enzymes. With seven types of MPS disorders and eleven subtypes, the MPS family presents unique challenges for early clinical diagnosis due to the molecular and clinical heterogeneity between groups and patients. Novel methods of early identification, particularly newborn screening through mass spectrometry, can change the flow of diagnosis, allowing enzyme and GAG quantification before the presentation of clinical symptoms improving outcomes. Genetic testing of patients and their families can also be conducted preemptively. This testing enables families to make informed decisions about family planning, leading to prenatal diagnosis. In this review, we discuss the clinical symptoms of each MPS type as they initially appear in patients, biochemical and molecular diagnostic methods, and the future of newborn screening for this group of disorders."

    "title": "Developmental and behavioral aspects of mucopolysaccharidoses with brain manifestations - Neurological signs and symptoms.",
    "abstract": "The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorders, caused by mutations in lysosomal enzymes involved in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The resulting accumulation of GAGs in the body leads to widespread tissue and organ dysfunction. The spectrum, severity, and progression rate of clinical manifestations varies widely between and within the different MPS types. In addition to somatic signs and symptoms, which vary between the different MPS disorders, patients with MPS I, II, III, and VII present with significant neurological signs and symptoms, including impaired cognitive abilities, difficulties in language and speech, and/or behavioral and sleep problems. To effectively manage and develop therapies that target these neurological manifestations, it is of utmost importance to have a profound knowledge of their natural history and pathophysiology. This review describes the appearance and progression of neurological signs and symptoms in patients with MPS I, II, and III, based on presentations and discussions among an international group of experts during a meeting on the brain in MPS on April 28-30, 2016, and additional literature searches on this subject."

    "title": "[Clinical characteristics of 111 cases with mucopolysaccharidosis ⅣA].",
    "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis ⅣA (MPS ⅣA). Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 111 patients with MPS ⅣA in Xinhua Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medcine from December 2008 to August 2020, confirmed by enzyme activity and genetic testing. General situation, clinical manifestations and enzyme activity test results were analyzed. According to the clinical manifestations, it can be divided into severe, intermediate and mild group. The independent sample t test was used to compare the birth body length and weight of children with that of normal boys and girls, and group comparisons of enzyme activities were evaluated by median test. Results: One hundred and eleven unrelated patients, 69 males and 42 females, were classified into 3 subtypes: severe (n=85), intermediate (n=14), and mild (n=12). The age at symptom onset were 1.6 (1.0, 3.0) years, and at diagnosis were 4.3 (2.8, 7.8) years. Skeletal manifestations were observed in all patients and consisted mainly of pectus carinatum (96/111, 86.5%), motor dysfunction (78/111, 70.3%), spinal deformity (71/111, 64.0%), growth retardation (64/111, 57.7%), joint laxity (63/111, 56.8%) and genu valgum (62/111, 55.9%). Eighty-eight patients (88/111, 79.3%) with MPS ⅣA were also along with non-skeletal manifestations, mainly including snoring (38/111, 34.2%), coarse faces (34/111, 30.6%), and visual impairment (26/111, 23.4%). The most common skeletal manifestation was pectus carinatum (79 cases), and non-skeletal manifestation was snoring (30 cases) and coarse faces (30 cases) in severe patients, pectus carinatum (13 cases) and snoring (5 cases) in intermediate type, motor dysfunction (11 cases) and snoring (3 cases) and visual impairment (3 cases) in mild patients. The height and weight of severe patients began to fall below -2 s at 2-<5 years and 5-<7 years, respectively. At the age of 10-<15 years, the standard deviation score of the height of severe patients reached (-6.2+/-1.6) s in males and (-6.4+/-1.2) s in females, and the score of weight got (-3.0+/-1.1) s in males and (-3.5+/-0.5) s in females. The height of intermediate patients began to fall below -2 s at the age of 7-<10 years, and the standard deviation score of height were -4.6 s and -3.6 s in 2 males, and -4.6 s and -3.8 s in 2 females at the age of 10-<15 years. The weight remained within -2 s in 72.0% (18/25) of intermediate patients compared to age-matched healthy children. In the mild patients with MPS ⅣA, the mean standard deviation score of height and weight was within -2 s. The enzyme activities of mild patients (2.02 (1.05, 8.20) nmol/(17 h.mg)) were both significantly higher than that of intermediate (0.57 (0.47, 0.94) nmol/(17 h.mg)) and severe (0.22 (0, 0.59) nmol/(17 h.mg)) patients (Z=9.91, 13.98, P=0.005, 0.001), and the enzyme activity of intermediate patients was significantly higher than that of severe patients (Z=8.56, P=0.010). Conclusions: The clinical manifestations of MPS ⅣA are charactered by pectus carinatum, motor function impairment, spinal deformity and growth retardation. The clinical characteristics, growth rate and enzyme activity differ among the 3 subtypes of MPS ⅣA."

    "abstract": "The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of rare (orphan) diseases, characterised by a deficiency of enzymes involved in the metabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) at lysosomal level. When there is a deficiency of a particular enzyme there is an accumulation of GAGs in the cells resulting in progressive cellular damage, which can affect multiple organ systems and lead to organ failure. Diagnosis is based on knowledge of the clinical manifestations, performing biochemical analyses to identify the type of GAG that is accumulating, and confirm the type of disorder with the corresponding enzymatic determination. Their identification is essential to initiate early treatment, taking into account that multidisciplinary management and enzyme replacement therapy is available for MPS I (Hurler syndrome), MPS II (Hunter syndrome), MPS IV (Morquio syndrome), and MPS VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. In this review, an analysis is made of each of these syndromes, as well as their diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders characterized by deficiencies in specific enzymes involved in the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These deficiencies cause excessive metabolites to accumulate in multiple organs. There are eight different MPS disorders, contributing to the wide variation in clinical presentation. Depending on the severity and subtype of the disease, some children live normal life spans, while others have a more grim prognosis. Children with MPS can present with neurologic, behavioral, skeletal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or respiratory abnormalities. Cutaneous manifestations are mostly nonspecific and can include coarse facial features, thickened skin, and excessive hair growth. More specific skin findings include ivory-colored \"pebbly\" papules found in Hunter syndrome and extensive dermal melanocytosis found in Hurler and Hunter syndromes. Early diagnosis of MPS disorders is extremely important to minimize the progression of the disease and for early initiation of appropriate treatment."

    "title": "Mucopolysaccharidoses and mucolipidoses.",
    "abstract": "The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) and mucolipidoses (ML) are progressive storage disorders that share many clinical features varying from facial dysmorphism, bone dysplasia, hepatosplenomegaly, neurological abnormalities, developmental regression, and a reduced life expectancy at the severe end of the clinical spectrum to an almost normal clinical phenotype and life span in patients with more attenuated disease. MPS and ML are transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner, except for the X-linked MPS II (Hunter syndrome). Diagnosis is initially by detecting partially degraded GAG or oligosaccharide in urine and confirmed by specific enzyme assays in serum, leukocytes, or skin fibroblasts. For the majority of disorders treatment is palliative, but there have been important advances in the use of specific enzyme replacement therapy strategies for some MPS disorders and this is an area of very rapid development. In addition, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can improve outcome in carefully selected patients with MPS (especially MPS IH, Hurler syndrome), but this procedure is associated with significant risk. Gene augmentation/transfer using a variety of vectors has been successful in animal models but has not yet been successfully performed in a human patient with one of these disorders. It is important to remember that prenatal diagnosis is possible for all of these disorders."

    "abstract": "The mucopolysaccharidoses are a heterogeneous group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders, characterized by the accumulation of undegraded glycosaminoglycans in various organs, leading to tissue damage. Mucopolysaccharidoses include eight individual disorders (IS [Scheie syndrome], IH [Hurler syndrome], II, III, IV, VI, VII and IX). They have autosomal-recessive transmission with the exception of mucopolysaccharidosis II, which is X-linked. Each individual disorder has a wide spectrum of phenotypic variation, depending on the specific mutation, from very mild to very severe. The skeletal and central nervous systems are particularly affected. The typical clinical presentation includes organomegaly, dysostosis multiplex with short trunk dwarfism, mental retardation and developmental delay. In this article, we review the neuroimaging manifestations of the different types of mucopolysaccharidoses including the dysostosis multiplex of the skull and spine as well as the various central nervous system complications. These include white matter injury, enlargement of the perivascular spaces, hydrocephalus, brain atrophy, characteristic enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces as well as compressive myelopathy. The correlation between several of the neuroimaging features and disease severity remains controversial, without well-established imaging biomarkers at this time. Imaging has, however, a crucial role in monitoring disease progression, in particular craniocervical junction stenosis, cord compression and hydrocephalus, because this allows for timely intervention before permanent damage occurs."

    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are progressive multisystem lysosomal storage diseases caused by defective catabolism of complex molecules, namely the glycosaminoglycans and their consequent accumulation in tissues. Of the 7 clinical types representing 11 different enzyme deficiencies, only MPS III (Sanfilippo syndromes A, B, C and D) and severe forms of MPS I (Hurler's syndrome), MPS II (severe Hunter syndrome) and MPS VII (severe Sly syndrome) give rise to progressive cerebral disease. Neurosensory complications (hearing impairment, retinopathy and optic atrophy) can also occur in some types. Carpal (or even tarsal) tunnel syndrome is a common complication of the MPS, except for MPS III and MPS IV. Hydrocephalus due to abnormal circulation or resorption of cerebrospinal fluid, chronic spinal compression may occur as complications of MPS I, II and VII and also in MPS IV and VI. Atlanto-axial instability may be observed in type IV and I."
