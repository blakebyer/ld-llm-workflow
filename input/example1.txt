Among the clinical findings found in MPS are general manifestations, such as short stature, infiltrated facies, thick eyebrows, as well as orthopedic manifestations (joint hypermobility or joint stiffness without inflammation, skeletal deformities, and multiple dysostosis), cardiac manifestations (murmur, myocardiopathy, mitral-aortic valve disease, cardiomegaly), and respiratory manifestations (hypertrophy of tonsils, adenoids, frequent respiratory infections). In other patients, there are umbilical and/or inguinal hernias, global retardation of psychomotor development, and the progressive loss of motor and intellectual skills they had already acquired in all but attenuated phenotypes and MPS IV and VI.
