    "title": "Two types of VIP neuronal components in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.",
    "abstract": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons constitute a large group in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and it is thought that they are involved in the generation and entrainment of circadian rhythm. We have characterized these VIP-expressing neurons in rat SCN by their ability to induce the mammalian Period1 (Per1) gene in response to light exposure, innervation of retinal afferents, day-night variations in VIP mRNA, and coexpression of gastrin releasing peptide (GRP). VIP neurons in the ventrolateral SCN (SCNVL) were subdivided into two groups, light-evoked Per1-inducible main SCNVL (SCNVLmain) and non-Per1-inducible medially located SCNVL (SCNVLmed). Retinal innervation was abundant in the SCNVLmain but nearly absent in the SCNVLmed. Day-night variation in VIP mRNA expression level was observed in the SCNVLmain but not in the SCNVLmed. GRP mRNA was seen in rarely SCNVLmed but abundant in SCNVLmain, where some neurons coexpressed VIP mRNA. These findings indicate that VIP neurons in the SCN can be divided into two topographically and functionally distinct groups."

    "title": "Giant pyramidal neurons of the primary motor cortex express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), a known marker of cortical interneurons.",
    "abstract": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is known to be present in a subclass of cortical interneurons. Here, using three different antibodies, we demonstrate that VIP is also present in the giant layer 5 pyramidal (Betz) neurons which are characteristic of the limb and axial representations of the marmoset primary motor cortex (cytoarchitectural area 4ab). No VIP staining was observed in smaller layer 5 pyramidal cells present in the primary motor facial representation (cytoarchitectural area 4c), or in the premotor cortex (e.g. the caudal subdivision of the dorsal premotor cortex, A6DC), indicating the selective expression of VIP in Betz cells. VIP in Betz cells was colocalized with neuronal specific marker (NeuN) and a calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV also intensely labelled axon terminals surrounding Betz cell somata. VIP-positive interneurons were more abundant in the superficial cortical layers and constituted about 5-7% of total cortical neurons, with the highest density observed in area 4c. Our results demonstrate the expression of VIP in the largest excitatory neurons of the primate cortex, which may offer new functional insights into the role of VIP in the brain, and provide opportunities for genetic manipulation of Betz cells.",

    "title": "Neurotransmitter phenotype and axonal projection patterns of VIP-expressing neurons in the inferior colliculus.",
    "abstract": "Neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC), the midbrain hub of the central auditory pathway, send ascending and descending projections to other auditory brain regions, as well as projections to other sensory and non-sensory brain regions. However, the axonal projection patterns of individual classes of IC neurons remain largely unknown. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide expressed by subsets of neurons in many brain regions. We recently identified a class of IC stellate neurons that we called VIP neurons because they are labeled by tdTomato (tdT) expression in VIP-IRES-Cre x Ai14 mice. Here, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that tdT+ neurons in VIP-IRES-Cre x Ai14 mice express Vglut2, a marker of glutamatergic neurons, and VIP, suggesting that VIP neurons use both glutamatergic and VIPergic signaling to influence their postsynaptic targets. Next, using viral transfections with a Cre-dependent eGFP construct, we labeled the axonal projections of VIP neurons. As a group, VIP neurons project intrinsically, within the ipsilateral and contralateral IC, and extrinsically to all the major targets of the IC. Within the auditory system, VIP neurons sent axons and formed axonal boutons in higher centers, including the medial geniculate nucleus and the nucleus of the brachium of the IC. Less dense projections terminated in lower centers, including the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, superior olivary complex, and dorsal cochlear nucleus. VIP neurons also project to several non-auditory brain regions, including the superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, and cuneiform nucleus. The diversity of VIP projections compared to the homogeneity of VIP neuron intrinsic properties suggests that VIP neurons play a conserved role at the microcircuit level, likely involving neuromodulation through glutamatergic and VIPergic signaling, but support diverse functions at the systems level through their participation in different projection pathways.",

    "title": "Transcriptomic profile of the subiculum-projecting VIP GABAergic neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampus.",
    "abstract": "In cortical circuits, the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP+)-expressing GABAergic cells represent a heterogeneous but unique group of interneurons that is mainly specialized in network disinhibition. While the physiological properties and connectivity patterns have been elucidated in several types of VIP+ interneurons, little is known about the cell type-specific molecular repertoires important for selective targeting of VIP+ cell types and understanding their functions. Using patch-sequencing approach, we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of anatomically identified subiculum-projecting VIP+ GABAergic neurons that reside in the mouse hippocampal CA1 area, express muscarinic receptor 2 and coordinate the hippocampo-subicular interactions via selective innervation of interneurons in the CA1 area and of interneurons and pyramidal cells in subiculum. We explored the VIP+ cell gene expression within major gene families including ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuromodulators, cell adhesion and myelination molecules. Among others, a large variety of genes involved in neuromodulatory signaling, including acetylcholine (Chrna4), norepinephrin (Adrb1), dopamine (Drd1), serotonin (Htr1d), cannabinoid (Cnr1), opioid (Oprd1, Oprl1) and neuropeptide Y (Npy1r) receptors was detected in these cells. Many genes that were enriched in other local VIP+ cell types, including the interneuron-selective interneurons and the cholecystokinin-coexpressing basket cells, were detected in VIP+ subiculum-projecting cells. In addition, the neuronatin (Nnat) and the Purkinje Cell Protein 4 (Pcp4) genes, which were detected previously in long-range projecting GABAergic neurons, were also common for the subiculum-projecting VIP+ cells. The expression of some genes was validated at the protein level, with proenkephalin being identified as an additional molecular marker of this VIP+ cell type. Together, our data indicate that the VIP+ subiculum-projecting cells share molecular identity with other VIP+ and long-range projecting GABAergic neurons, which can be important for specific function of these cells associated with their local and distant projection patterns."

    "title": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus provide sparse GABAergic outputs to local neurons with circadian regulation occurring distal to the opening of postsynaptic GABAA ionotropic receptors.",
    "abstract": "GABAergic synaptic transmission plays an important role in resetting and synchronizing circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Although the circadian modulation of intrinsic membrane currents and biochemical signaling have been examined in the SCN, the modulation of specific synaptic pathways within the SCN is unexplored. In addition, little is known about the functional properties of these pathways, including which ones involve GABAA receptors (GABAA-Rs). In brain slices obtained from mice, we examined synaptic responses originating from the SCN neurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP+ neurons). Focusing on the local projection within the ventromedial SCN, we found that VIP+ afferents provided input onto 49% of neurons with a preference for VIP-negative (VIP-) neurons. Responses were mediated by GABAA-Rs. The projection was sparsely connected and preferentially targeted a subset of SCN neurons unrelated to postsynaptic VIP expression. For most aspects of VIP+ network output, there was no circadian regulation. Excitability and spontaneous firing of the presynaptic VIP+ neurons were unchanged between day and night, and their network connectivity and synaptic function up through the evoked synaptic conductance were also unchanged. On the other hand, VIP+ input onto VIP- neurons became less inhibitory at night suggesting a postsynaptic alteration in the coupling of GABAA-R conductances to action potential firing. These data suggest that components of the VIP network and its synaptic output up through GABAA-R opening are invariant during the circadian cycle, but the effect on action potential firing is modulated by postsynaptic processes occurring after GABAA-R channel opening.",

    "title": "Characterizing VIP Neurons in the Barrel Cortex of VIPcre/tdTomato Mice Reveals Layer-Specific Differences.",
    "abstract": "Neocortical GABAergic interneurons have a profound impact on cortical circuitry and its information processing capacity. Distinct subgroups of inhibitory interneurons can be distinguished by molecular markers, such as parvalbumin, somatostatin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Among these, VIP-expressing interneurons sparked a substantial interest since these neurons seem to operate disinhibitory circuit motifs found in all major neocortical areas. Several of these recent studies used transgenic Vip-ires-cre mice to specifically target the population of VIP-expressing interneurons. This makes it necessary to elucidate in detail the sensitivity and specificity of Cre expression for VIP neurons in these animals. Thus, we quantitatively compared endogenous tdTomato with Vip fluorescence in situ hybridization and alphaVIP immunohistochemistry in the barrel cortex of VIPcre/tdTomato mice in a layer-specific manner. We show that VIPcre/tdTomato mice are highly sensitive and specific for the entire population of VIP-expressing neurons. In the barrel cortex, approximately 13% of all GABAergic neurons are VIP expressing. Most VIP neurons are found in layer II/III ( approximately 60%), whereas approximately 40% are found in the other layers of the barrel cortex. Layer II/III VIP neurons are significantly different from VIP neurons in layers IV-VI in several morphological and membrane properties, which suggest layer-dependent differences in functionality.",

    "abstract": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons in the cortex regulate feedback inhibition of pyramidal neurons through suppression of somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons and, reciprocally, SST neurons inhibit VIP neurons. Although VIP neuron activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mouse is highly correlated with locomotion, the relevance of locomotion-related VIP neuron activity to visual coding is not known. Here we show that VIP neurons in mouse V1 respond strongly to low contrast front-to-back motion that is congruent with self-motion during locomotion but are suppressed by other directions and contrasts. VIP and SST neurons have complementary contrast tuning. Layer 2/3 contains a substantially larger population of low contrast preferring pyramidal neurons than deeper layers, and layer 2/3 (but not deeper layer) pyramidal neurons show bias for front-to-back motion specifically at low contrast. Network modeling indicates that VIP-SST mutual antagonism regulates the gain of the cortex to achieve sensitivity to specific weak stimuli without compromising network stability.",

    "abstract": "Our previous study revealed the expression of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in sensory distal ganglion of the vagus (nodose ganglion) neurons in the pig. As these neuropeptides may be involved in nociception, the goal of these investigations was to determine possible expression of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), SP and CGRP in the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-immunoreactive (PACAP-IR) porcine nodose perikarya. Co-expression of these substances was examined using a double-labelling immunofluorescence technique. To reveal the ganglionic cell bodies, the pan-neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) was used. Quantitative analysis of the neurons revealed that 67.25% of the PGP 9.5+ somata in the right-side ganglion and 66.5% in the left side, respectively, co-expressed PACAP-IR. Moreover, 60.6% of the PACAP-IR cells in the right-side ganglion and 62.1% in the left, respectively, co-expressed VIP. SP-IR was observed in 52.2 and 39.9% of the right and left ganglia, respectively. CGRP was found in 27.7 and 34.1% of the right and left distal ganglion of the vagus, respectively. High level of co-expression of PACAP with VIP, SP and CGRP in the distal ganglia of the vagus sensory perikarya directly implicates studied peptides in their functional interaction during nociceptive vagal transduction."

    "title": "Cortical VIP neurons as a critical node for dopamine actions.",
    "abstract": "Dopamine modulates a wide range of cognitive processes in the prefrontal cortex, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined the roles of prefrontal vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing neurons and their D1 receptors (D1Rs) in working memory using a delayed match-to-sample task in mice. VIP neurons conveyed robust working-memory signals, and their inactivation impaired behavioral performance. Moreover, selective knockdown of D1Rs in VIP neurons also resulted in impaired performance, indicating the critical role of VIP neurons and their D1Rs in supporting working memory. Additionally, we found that dopamine release dynamics during the delay period varied depending on the target location. Furthermore, dopaminergic terminal stimulation induced a contralateral response bias and enhanced neuronal target selectivity in a laterality-dependent manner. These results suggest that prefrontal dopamine modulates behavioral responses and delay-period activity based on laterality. Overall, these findings shed light on dopamine-modulated prefrontal neural processes underlying higher-order cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "Structural synaptic plasticity may underlie experience and learning-dependent changes in cortical circuits. In contrast to excitatory pyramidal neurons, insight into the structural plasticity of inhibitory neurons remains limited. Interneurons are divided into various subclasses, each with specialized functions in cortical circuits. Further knowledge of subclass-specific structural plasticity of interneurons is crucial to gaining a complete mechanistic understanding of their contribution to cortical plasticity overall. Here, we describe a subpopulation of superficial cortical multipolar interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) with high spine densities on their dendrites located in layer (L) 1, and with the electrophysiological characteristics of bursting cells. Using longitudinal imaging in vivo, we found that the majority of the spines are highly dynamic, displaying lifetimes considerably shorter than that of spines on pyramidal neurons. Using correlative light and electron microscopy, we confirmed that these VIP spines are sites of excitatory synaptic contacts, and are morphologically distinct from other spines in L1.",
